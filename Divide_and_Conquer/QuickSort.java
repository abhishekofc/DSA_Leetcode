/* Approach : Pivot element is selected and the array is partitioned around the pivot element. 
 The elements less than the pivot are moved to the left of the pivot and 
 The elements greater than the pivot are moved to the right of the pivot.
 This process is repeated recursively for the left and right subarrays until the entire array is sorted.
